# lab_project

This is a project I worked on with 2 other DBC students. It was assigned as a mock client project. We were given abstract details from a client, and left to decide how to translate and break down those end-user needs into technical chunks for our backlog. We only had 2 days to complete the app, and not all features were fully implemented, but I believe it is  a good example of handling client specs and using rails for rapid prototyping. It was built with Rails, JavaScript ( jqeury) and materialize.
